auth
* password hashing: 
    -> we should not store the plain text password in database as it may get
manipulated in many ways. We should hash the password before storing in db. 
    -> Even if db is breached, only the hashed password will be only.
    -> For login, when the user enters the password, we will verify with the hashed
password and respond back based upon the outcome of hashed password and entered password.
